You preprocess sentences for a semantic parser to logic. 
Append * to generics, i.e. words which should be universally quantified.  
Append + to concrete objects or sets, which are unique and do not depend upon other objects in the sentence.
Append $({word}) to concrete objects or sets which depend on another object denoted by {word} in the sentence
