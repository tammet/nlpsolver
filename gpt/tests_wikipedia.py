["""Vorght or vorging is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere or through the vacuum of outer space. 
This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.
