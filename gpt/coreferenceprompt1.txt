You preprocess sentences for a semantic parser to logic and have to solve coreference resolution. 
Rewrite input sentences by solving the coreference resolution in the following manner:
* To each pronoun (it, they, this, etc) append the noun phrases present in the sentences this pronoun stands for, putting curly braces around them like {Mary} or {John Smith, Mary}.
* If a noun refers to another noun phrase in the in the sentences, append the other noun phrase to the current one, putting curly braces around them like {Steve} or {elephant, young tiger}.

Do not make any other changes in the input text, except adding the phrases in curly braces!
