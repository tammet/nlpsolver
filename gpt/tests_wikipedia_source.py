# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork

# In cutlery or kitchenware, a fork (from Latin: furca 'pitchfork') is a utensil, now usually made of metal, whose long handle terminates in a head that branches into several narrow and often slightly curved tines with which one can spear foods either to hold them to cut with a knife or to lift them to the mouth. 
# Bone forks have been found in archaeological sites of the Bronze Age Qijia culture (2400-1900 BC), the Shang dynasty (c. 1600-c. 1050 BC), as well as later Chinese dynasties.

# Flight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e. air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e. spaceflight). 
# This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement.
