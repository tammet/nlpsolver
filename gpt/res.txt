result: Semantic parsing, the process of converting natural language into symbolic representation, stands as a cornerstone in the field of artificial intelligence. Our paper explores various methods for encoding concepts derived from semantic parsing into enhanced first-order logic. Our aim is to boost the efficiency of automated reasoning while maintaining an encoding that is straightforward enough for human oversight and comprehension.  Despite the extensive research dedicated to semantic parsing, its practical application has been somewhat limited. This limitation can be attributed to several factors: the inherent complexity of accurately interpreting natural language, the suboptimal performance of reasoning systems when processing parser outputs, and the significant constraints of the knowledge bases available to reasoning engines.  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has, to some extent, overshadowed the interest in semantic parsing. Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated superior performance on numerous benchmarks related to question answering and commonsense reasoning, surpassing systems built upon semantic parsers. Conversely, LLMs are increasingly being utilized as tools for semantic parsing, yielding results that arguably surpass those obtained through traditional semantic parsing techniques.  While LLMs undoubtedly excel in language-focused tasks compared to other existing techniques, they are not without their flaws. These include erroneous inferences (often referred to as "hallucinations"), a lack of explainability and controllability, and the complexity involved in updating or modifying the information upon which the LLM has been trained. These limitations hinder their applicability in scenarios that demand precision, control, and the management of frequently changing data—characteristics typical of most conventional IT systems. It remains uncertain whether future iterations of LLMs will address these issues or if entirely new paradigms will be necessary.  Despite the challenges outlined above, it is evident that LLMs are not inherently suited for tasks that require search capabilities, such as planning, theorem proving, or identifying lengthy inference chains. Simply put, LLMs lack built-in search algorithms.  An increasing amount of research focuses on leveraging LLMs as specialized semantic parsers that produce symbolic inputs for traditional software systems, such as planners or programming language interpreters. These systems, tasked with solving problems initially presented in natural language, can benefit from the integration of machine learning components tailored to specific tasks.  Our approach to semantic parsing involves generating a representation that is versatile enough for a broad range of query answering and planning tasks, whether used directly or through subsequent transformations. We employ enhanced first-order logic for symbolic representation and validate the generated representations by utilizing an enhanced first-order logic theorem prover for question answering.  As a general principle, specialized representations tend to be more efficient and user-friendly for specific tasks compared to general representations, such as first-order logic. However, in scenarios where a substantial volume of text must be symbolically represented to facilitate various queries and tasks—such as within a dialogue system—it may not be practical to create a suitable specialized representation in advance.
